"""Horvitz-Thompson coefficients for point-coincidence scenes.

A scene's contraction merges subscripts, so it performs a **free sum** over its
blocks -- assignments that put two blocks on the same sampled coordinate are
counted.  The estimator needs the blocks mutually distinct.  So the free sum of a
scene counts every tuple whose exact coincidence pattern is *finer* than that
scene, and the weight that makes the sum unbiased is not the naive
``w(k) = C(M,k)/C(Np,k)``.

Write ``Free_sigma`` for a scene's free sum and ``C_pi`` for the sum over tuples
whose exact pattern is ``pi``.  A tuple with pattern ``pi`` is counted by
``Free_sigma`` exactly when ``sigma`` is coarser than ``pi``, so

    E[Free_sigma] = sum over pi finer than sigma of C_pi / w_E(|pi|)

and therefore

    sum_sigma c(sigma) E[Free_sigma] = sum_pi C_pi / w_E(|pi|)
                                        * sum over sigma finer than pi of c(sigma).

Unbiasedness for every ``pi`` therefore requires

    sum over sigma finer than pi of c(sigma) = w_E(|pi|),

i.e. the zeta inversion ``Z^T c = w`` on the refinement partial order, with
``Z[i][j] = 1`` iff scene ``i`` is finer than scene ``j``.

Two consequences worth stating because they are easy to get wrong:

* At ``r = 1`` the equation collapses to ``c = w_E(1) = M/Np``, which is what the
  old code used, so single-point groups keep their arithmetic exactly.
* ``w(0)`` for an empty group is 1 by definition (one empty tuple, always drawn).

Coefficients are rational and, in the ``w_E`` scheme, often integral.  They are
computed and stored as :class:`fractions.Fraction`: the float residual of the
solve already reaches ``3e-12`` at ``r = 4`` on production-sized ``M``, which is
far too large to bake into a lookup table.
